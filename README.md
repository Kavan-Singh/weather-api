Option 2 for the weather api code challenge

Kavan Singh

## Prompt: 
Weather Application
Problem: 

When I travel I never know what to pack. Given some location I think the api limits to 5 days for free. It is fine to assume everyone is traveling for 5 days from today. Get the weather and suggest types of clothes to pack for each day. For example, if the weather is going to be 90 one day and 20 the next day. The traveler will need to pack shorts, tshirt and warm clothes.

    Use OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather. (https://openweathermap.org/api)
    Display Weather for each day and what types of items that are needed for the trip.

Option 1: build a react app to request the weather and display it to the user in their browser. def bonus points if you can make this look aesthetically pleasing, throw in some images, icons, etc..
    
Option 2: build a REST API using express.js where the user submits a zip code to a REST API endpoint, then the REST endpoint performs the API request to open weather app and returns what the user would need to wear. i.e. i could submit zip code 20001, it'll say its sunny and hot for one day and your API would return some JSON object that says the temperature for that day and what clothes to wear.
